Assistant for the Lava Water and Purple IC in Voidlands, beacause that IC kinda sucks

## Installing
### The Two Versions
In every release, you will see two files, one ending with .love and another .zip . The difference between these two files is that the .zip version comes bundled with a version of Love2d (what this thing was made with), but the .love version requires you to head to download the latest version of Love2d. The choice is entirely subjective, each version has their own ups and downs, but it doesn't really matter that much. Either way it's roughly 4MB (most of it being Love2d.)
