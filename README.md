## Installation
### The Two Versions
In every release, you will see two files, one ending with .love and another .zip . The difference between these two files is that the .zip version comes bundled with a version of Love2d (what this thing was made with), but the .love version requires you to head to download the latest version of Love2d. The choice is entirely subjective, each version has their own ups and downs, but it doesn't really matter that much. Either way it's roughly 4MB (most of it being Love2d.)

### Actually Installing it
#### .zip
Simply download the zip file, unzip it wherever you want, and run the .exe file.

#### .love
Head to the [Love2d Website](https://love2d.org/) and download the latest version (I recommend using the installer, but you do you.) Once it's installed, right click the file, click open with, and navigate to your love2d directory and choose love (also if you don't check "Always open use this app to open .love" you are stupid)

Ok look you probably can figure this stuff out but im tryina cover all cases here
